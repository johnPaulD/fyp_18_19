2D6,Result
2,Sweltering Heat: It's so hot and humid that some players collapse from heat exhaustion. Roll a D6 for each player on the pitch at the end of a drive. On a roll of 1 the player collapses and may not be set up for the next kick-off.
3,Very Sunny: A glorious day, but the blinding sunshine causes a -1 modifier on all passing rolls.
4-10,Nice: Perfect Blood Bowl weather.
11,Pouring Rain: It's raining, making the ball slippery and difficult to hold. A -1 modifier applies to all catch, intercept, or pick-up rolls.
12,Blizzard: It's cold and snowing! The ice on the pitch means that any player attempting to move an extra square (GFI) will slip and be Knocked Down on a roll of 1-2, while the snow means that only quick or short passes can be attempted.
